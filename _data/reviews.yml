      feedback: Adriana was amazing! I had just started my first gig as a Junior FrontEnd engineer, feeling all kinds of self-doubt and overwhelmed by the new skills I needed to learn. Adriana offered the support and guidance I needed to feel more confident and navigate the demands of my role.

      feedback: It was a weird time because I applied for the mentorship when I was looking for a job and then I found a job just before it started so that limited the amount of help that Nassim could give just because of my situation, I still greatly enjoyed it and found it very helpful

      feedback: The mentorship had an excellent impact on my personal and professional growth. It provided me with valuable insights into fundamental technical concepts in my field, such as unit testing. I was able to have a clearer path on where to begin and, throughout the process, identify areas for improvement. Moreover, having someone to talk to during moments of demotivation and gaining a broader perspective on the market were essential aspects of my growth.

      feedback: My mentee journey with Tara has been amazing. Tara is very patient and very passionate about her job, about engineering and about mentoring. Since I became her mentee, Tara has helped me with code blockers, emotional and general study issues. Her patience and complete dedication to the mentoring sessions is just fantastic and has helped me to grow and become more confident in my new career path as a career switcher into tech. She communicates very effectively with me whenever she needs to, and I in turn have learned how to communicate better too. Tara's advice and insights are always very practical and straight to the point. To help me learn and become better, she also assumes the role of a student and pushes me to figure things out in ways I would not think of. I am really very grateful to her mentoring and could not have asked for a better mentor. Thank you WWC-London

The most important thing is never stop belive in yourself and what you capabile of . Keep work hard stuck with your goal and make it happen whatever it takes . When I signed the job contract I was still saying myself like 'did I make it ? I stll can't belive it :) ' This is the most exited thing that I had so far . I wonder what is next :).
