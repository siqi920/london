  position: Senior iOS Developer, Novoda
  bio: |
    I'm a senior iOS developer with ten years of business experience and over 25 years in software development. I spent the first 15 years working as a back-end developer in .NET and Java, but I fell in love when I discovered Mobile development. I am passionate about the quality and maintainability of the application's code and architecture.
    <br>I have already lived in some European cities, such as Lisbon, Madrid, Barcelona and London. This allowed me to work in different cultures and dynamics, further increasing my ability to connect, communicate and grow. I love giving back to the community, so I started collaborating with DevPass, helping guide newcomers. I'm also a mentor at MentoCruise, for those who want a more professional follow-up.
